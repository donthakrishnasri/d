<h3> Web Evolution &amp How it Works?</h3>
The web today is a growing universe of interlinked web pages and web apps, teeming with videos, photos and interactive content. What the average user doesn't see is the interplay of web technologies and browsers that makes all this possible. Over time, web technologies have evolved to give web developers the ability to create new generations of useful and immersive web experiences. Today's web is a result of the ongoing efforts of an open web community that helps define these web technologies, like HTML5, CSS3 and many more., Web 1.0 – static web Experts call the Internet before 1999 “Read-Only” web. The average internet user’s role was limited to reading the information which was presented to him. The best examples of this 1.0 web era are millions of static websites  There was no active communication or information flow from consumer (of the information) to producer (of the information). Web 2.0 – The writing and participating web The lack of active interaction of common users with the web leads to the birth of Web 2.0. This interaction and contribution has dramatically changed the landscape of the web […]. It has even more potential that we have yet to see. […] The Web 2.0 appears to be a welcome response to a web users demand to be more involved in what information is available to them. This era empowered the common user with a few new concepts like Blogs, Social-Media &amp Video-Streaming. Publishing your content is only a few clicks away! Few remarkable developments of Web 2.0 are Twitter, YouTube, Flickr and Facebook.

 Web Standards, Website &amp Web page.
Web standards are rules and guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed to promote consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. These are best-practice standards used by organizations to build web sites and web applications. Website: A website is a collection of related web pages, including multimedia content, typically identified with a common domain name, and published on at least one web server. A website may be accessible via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, or a private local area network (LAN), by referencing a uniform resource locator (URL) that identifies the site. A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "web site" or simply a "site." Web page: A web page or web page is a document commonly written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that is accessible through the Internet or other network using an Internet browser. A web page is accessed by entering a URL address and may contain text, graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files.  A web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device.

 Protocols, Domain Name &amp Hosting, Editors (Developer Tools/IDE&aposs).:
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for electronic mail (email) transmission.  The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.  HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an adaptation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.

Hosting — rented file space on a hosting company's web server. You put your website files on this space, and the web server serves the content to web users who request it. ✓A domain name — the unique address where people can find your website, like http://www.mozilla.org. You rent your domain name for so many years from a domain registrar.

Types of Domain Names: .in is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for India .com – the most popular domain suffix.  used for commercial purposes .org – organisational domain suffix, global.  .net – originally intended for network related companies (short for ‘network’) . info – a new domain suffix, intended for sites that provide information. .edu – for Educational websites. .biz – a shortened version of ‘businesses used for general information and business sites. .tv - short for ‘television’ - often used by broadcasters.

		<h3>Define HTML &and its Versions</h3>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[4] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt img /&gt and &lt input /&gt directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt p &gt surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997&lt/p &gt

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[4] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt img /&gt and &lt input /&gt directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt p &gt surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
